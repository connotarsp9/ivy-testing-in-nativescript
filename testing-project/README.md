This is an edited NativeScript + Angular app structure (package.json containing the deps of a real {N} + Angular app) created from template (tns create test-ivy â€”ng) but the files necessary for actually running the app have been removed. The idea is to simply call `ivy-ngcc` on the related packages and not run the {N} app.

# Testing the project
Execute `npm run start-ngcc`
